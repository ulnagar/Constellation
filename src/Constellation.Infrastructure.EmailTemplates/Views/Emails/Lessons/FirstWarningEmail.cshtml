<p></p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p></p>We are writing to you in regards to the Science Practical lessons at @Model.SchoolName. The following lessons have been flagged as not completed in the last fortnight block.</p>
<ul>
    @foreach (var entry in Model.Lessons)
    {
        <li>@entry.Name (Due by @entry.DueDate.ToShortDateString())</li>
    }
</ul>
<p>Could you please arrange a catch up session to complete this practical activity as soon as possible and then tick it off on the SPT website (at <a href="@Model.Link" target="_blank">@Model.Link</a>)</p>
<p></p>Thank you for your work with our shared students.</p>
