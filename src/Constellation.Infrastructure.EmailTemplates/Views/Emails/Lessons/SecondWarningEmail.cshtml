<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>It is vital that we complete the mandatory practical component of our Aurora College student's science courses. Our records indicate that @Model.SchoolName is falling behind in the delivery of the practical lessons listed.</p>
<ul>
    @foreach (var entry in Model.Lessons)
    {
        <li>@entry.Name (Due by @entry.DueDate.ToShortDateString())</li>
    }
</ul>
<p>Could you please arrange a catch up session to complete this practical activity as soon as possible and then tick it off on the SPT website (at <a href="@Model.Link" target="_blank">@Model.Link</a>)</p>
<p>Thank you for your work with our shared students.</p>
