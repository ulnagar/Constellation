<p>Dear @Model.ParentName,</p>

@if (Model.WholeAbsences.Any())

    <p>@Model.StudentFirstName was absent from class on the following dates and no satisfactory explanation has been received.</p>
    <dl>

    <p>The <i>Education Act 1990</i> requires parents/carers to ensure their child attends school each day that instruction is provided, unless they are prevented from doing so by sickness or another acceptable reason. Parents/carers must also provide an explanation for any absence within seven days of the absence.</p>
    <p>Failure to do so will result in an unjustified absence being recorded.</p>
    <p>Please provide an explanation as soon as possible for the @(Model.WholeAbsences.Count > 1 ? "absences" : "absence") listed using our Parent Portal: <a href="@ParentAbsenceDigestEmailViewModel.Link" target="_blank">@ParentAbsenceDigestEmailViewModel.Link</a></p>

    <p>@Model.StudentFirstName is required to provide an explanation for the @(Model.PartialAbsences.Count > 1 ? "absences" : "absence") which will then be verified by the home school.</p>
    <p>To date, no explanation of these partial absences has been received.</p>
    <p>Please encourage @Model.StudentFirstName to enter an explanation for this absence using the link sent to them via email.</p>
