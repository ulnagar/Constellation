<p>The <i>Education Act 1990</i> requires you to ensure your child attends school each day that instruction is provided unless they are prevented from doing so by sickness or other acceptable reason and for you to provide an explanation for any absence.</p>
<p>The Act requires you to explain your child's absences within seven days of their occurrence. Failure to do so will result in an unjustified absence being recorded.</p>
<p>Please provide an explanation of these absences using our Parent Portal as soon as possible: <a href="@Model.Link" target="_blank">@Model.Link</a></p>
