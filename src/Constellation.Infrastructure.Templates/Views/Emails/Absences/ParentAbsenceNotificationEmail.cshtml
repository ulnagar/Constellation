<p>Dear @Model.ParentName,</p>

<p>Regular attendance at school is important for students to reach their potential. The school is required to record the reason for any absences as a way of ensuring that students are absent from school only when they are sick or have another good reason for missing school.</p>

<p>Your child, @Model.StudentFirstName, was absent from the following lessons, and no explanation has been received.</p>

<dl>
    @foreach (var entry in Model.Absences)
    {
        <dt>@entry.Date.ToLongDateString()</dt>
        <dd>@entry.PeriodName (@entry.PeriodTimeframe) - @entry.OfferingName</dd>
    }
</dl>

<p>Please assist us by using our Parent Portal as soon as possible: <a href="@ParentAbsenceNotificationEmailViewModel.Link" target="_blank">@ParentAbsenceNotificationEmailViewModel.Link</a></p>

<p>Alternatively, you may wish to contact the school on 1300 287 629 or at <a href="mailto:auroracoll-h.school@det.nsw.edu.au">auroracoll-h.school@det.nsw.edu.au</a> to discuss your child's attendance.</p>
